# Programs-I-wrote-during-clg
I created this public repository with the main goal of collecting simple but useful programs I wrote while in college, to better understand some of the concepts in computer science that I felt required a bit more effort to understand. It, I believe, would also serve other students by helping them visualize how a visual implementation of the concept would look like, and in the process enable them to understand the concept better. Besides, I feel that this repository can be used as a ready reference, with important algorithms that might find use later in my career (like sorting, searching etc.) all in one place.
